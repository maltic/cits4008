\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Here the recorded run time for RNAfold, MEA, and CoFold is depicted as a scatter plot. The time used by all algorithms increases with increasing RNA length. The length of an RNA is defined as the number of nucleotides it compromises. A purple line representing a generic cubic curve is included for comparison. This line has been scaled by a constant so that it remains visible on the diagram.\relax }}{8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Here the recorded run time for only smaller RNAs ($< 400$ nucleotides) is depicted as a scatter plot. A purple line representing a generic cubic curve is included for comparison. This line has been scaled by a constant so that it remains visible on the diagram.\relax }}{9}
